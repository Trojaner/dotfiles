# Trojaner's dotfiles
Dotfiles that install my personal configurations to make life easier.  
Includes various configs and their setup scripts for Windows & Linux. The Linux scripts only support Debian based systems.  

All configurations are symlinked to the local repo directory for easy updates, so don't delete the repo after running the setup scripts.  

**Disclaimer**: the setup scripts automatically add my public key to the authorized keys, which is something you likely don't wanna do, but if you do, I wouldn't mind it :)
